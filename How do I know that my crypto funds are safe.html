<h2>How do I know that my crypto funds are safe?</h2>

<p>
Parfin offers a state-of-the-art custody solution powered by MPC technology. 
Your funds are protected by encrypted private key shares and Parfin does not hold all the shares necessary to broadcast transactions into the network, we require a trusted 3rd party to agree to sign every transaction before it can be broadcasted.

In addition, Parfin has a disaster recovery policy in place, in the unlikely event that anything happens to either Parfin or our trusted 3rd party, there are mechanisms in place to enable all funds from all our customers to be recovered.
