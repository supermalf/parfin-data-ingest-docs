<h2>Our history</h2>
<p>
Parfin was born from the belief that digital assets would revolutionize the world in a similar way to what the internet had done in the 90s.
</p>

<p>
What they call the web3 revolution, for us, is evolution. That's how, in 2019, a trio of entrepreneurs saw a paradigm shift, but institutions were not prepared and would need infrastructure for this transition.
</p>

<p>
And thus, we became protagonists of the new reality of the financial system.
</p>

<p>
We have the vision that it is possible to open new possibilities, new business models, new sources of profit. To have a positive impact on people's way of living, interacting with money, and conducting financial operations.
